SumoLogic Recorded Future Integration
=====================================

The installation of the SumoLogic Recorded Future integration is easy.
There are in 5 easy steps, starting with setting up your SumoLogic 
environment, getting your Recorded Future API key, and then organizing 
how you want to see your threat intelligence data.

Setup Steps
===========

[SumoLogic Source Setup](01_sources/readme.md)

[SumoLogic Ingest Setup](02_ingest/readme.md)

[Recorded Future Setup](03_config/readme.md)

[SumoLogic Script Setup](04_script/readme.md)

[SumoLogic Query Setup](05_queries/readme.md)

As an overview, the first two steps plan how you want to import, 
or ingest, the data into SumoLogic. 

Then, the next two steps show how to get the information from 
both Recorded Future and SumoLogic to drive the script.

The last step pulls all of this together, and makes your threat
intelligence import automatic.
