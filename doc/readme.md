Sumo Logic Recorded Future Integration
======================================

The installation of the Sumo Logic Recorded Future integration is easy.
There are in 5 easy steps, starting with setting up your Sumo Logic 
environment, getting your Recorded Future API key, and then organizing 
how you want to see your threat intelligence data.

Setup Steps
===========

[Step-1: Sumo Logic Preparation](01_sumologic/readme.md)

[Step-2: Recorded Future Preparation](02_recordedfuture/readme.md)

[Step-3: Integration Setup](03_integration/readme.md)

As an overview, the first step plan how you want to import, 
or ingest, the data into Sumo Logic. 

The next step ensures we have the right subscription and setup
for Recorded Future.

The last step pulls all of this together, and makes your threat
intelligence import automatic.
